    <!--I had started writing the HTML between the time I emailed you and you emailed me back, so here's a combo of what I started and what you responded with in your email-->
    <h1>Stories</h1>
    <h2>1. GET /stories</h2>
    <h3>View all stories</h3>
    <p>This allows you to see a summary (ID and title) of all stories in the db</p>
    <button>View all stories</button>

    <h2>2. GET /stories/:id</h2>
    <h3>Get a story with by an ID</h3>

    <form>
        <label for="storyId">Story ID:</label>
        <input type="text" placeholder="type ID here">
        <button>Find story</button>
    </form>
    

    <h2>3. POST /stories</h2>

        <button>submit ID</button>
        <p> There should be a text box and submit button for each: title and content. Or maybe just one submit button for all. Or something else. I need to stop thinking about it for now.</p>
